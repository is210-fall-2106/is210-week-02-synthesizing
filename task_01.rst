Why I Love Python
#################

Why I love **Python**, a language worth knowing.

**********
Running It
**********

Python syntax is really quite simple to execute. Anyone can do it just by executing the PYTHON command on the command line and invoking the interpreter.

You can also execute python programs by calling the program filename such as:

``me@mymachine $ python my_file_name.py``

**********
The Syntax
**********

Python syntax is very easy to write. Take a look at this simple statement:

``>>> print 'Hello!'``

**********
The People
**********

It's amazing how nice people are in the Python development world. Just as with any community, however, it's important to follow certain rules of decorum.

* Be courteous to others
* Always read the manual before asking questions
* Be succinct in your questions
  * Don't give unnecessary details if they aren't needed
  * Don't start a question with an apology or an announcement that you're going to ask the question.
    *Just ask the question!*
